### About me

Hello! My name is Oleg Alexander. I was born in Ukraine, moved to Israel when I was 9, and moved to the US when I was 12. My majors were Fine Art in high school and Filmmaking/3D Animation in college. I also taught Maya at my university. 

After college, I worked as a Technical Artist in the VFX/3D Animation/Games industry for about 10 years, focusing on realistic facial animation. During that time, I also tried very hard and failed spectacularly to make a short film. I certainly learned a lot from that experience. 

I'm currently a Senior R&D Engineer at Lowe's Innovation Labs where I work on the future of home improvement retail. My interests include learning different programming languages, statically typed functional programming, Lean thinking, and movies. I'm a husband and father. I also volunteer at my local 4-H Robotics club.
