### About me

Hello, I'm Oleg. I was born in Ukraine and moved to the US when I was 12. My majors were Fine Art in high school and Filmmaking/3D Animation in college. During college, I also taught Maya at my university. 

After college, I worked as a Technical Artist in the VFX/3D Animation industry for about 10 years focusing on realistic facial animation. During that time, I also tried very hard and failed spectacularly to make a short film. I certainly learned a lot from that experience. 

I currently work as a Senior R&D Engineer at Lowe's Innovation Labs. My interests include learning different programming languages, statically typed functional programming, Lean thinking, and movies. I'm a husband and father. I also volunteer at my local 4-H Robotics club.
